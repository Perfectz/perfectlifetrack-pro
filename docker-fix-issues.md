# Docker Container Issues Fixed

This document summarizes the issues encountered with the Docker containers and how they were fixed.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing start.sh Script**
   - Error: `/bin/sh: can't open '/app/start.sh': No such file or directory`
   - Container CMD was referencing a start.sh script that didn't exist

2. **Package.json Not Found**
   - Error: `npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/package.json'`
   - Volume mounts were causing file access issues

3. **Container Not Initialized**
   - Error: `Error: Container fitness not initialized`
   - Container was trying to access database before initialization completed

4. **Theme Import Error**
   - Error: `Failed to resolve import "../../src/theme" from "src/App.tsx". Does the file exist?`
   - Path error in the import statement

5. **Network Communication**
   - Frontend couldn't reach backend service properly using localhost

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Configuration

- **Backend Dockerfile**:
  - Added proper creation of start.sh script with error handling
  - Ensured the script is executable with `chmod +x`
  - Used explicit CMD to run the script

- **Frontend Dockerfile**:
  - Added proper creation of start.sh script
  - Set proper host binding for development environment
  - Fixed command execution

### 2. Resolved Volume Mount Issues

- Removed problematic volume mounts in docker-compose file
- Used Docker image content instead of trying to mount local files
- Updated .dockerignore files to ensure proper files are included

### 3. Improved Container Management

- Created robust Docker-compose configuration with:
  - Custom network configuration
  - Health checks to ensure services are ready
  - Proper service dependencies
  - Increased timeout values

### 4. Fixed Application Code

- Updated App.tsx to define theme locally, fixing import errors
- Created proper theme structure to avoid reliance on external file

### 5. Enhanced Startup Scripts

- Created comprehensive PowerShell scripts:
  - docker-run.ps1: Robust container startup with pre-checks and clean environment
  - docker-stop.ps1: Proper container shutdown
  - docker-reset.ps1: Complete environment reset for troubleshooting

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Explicit Script Creation**: Always create scripts inside the container rather than relying on mounted files
2. **Health Checks**: Added proper health checks with reasonable start periods
3. **Container Names**: Used explicit container names to make management easier
4. **Network Configuration**: Explicit network configuration for inter-service communication
5. **Error Handling**: Better error handling in scripts
6. **Dockerfile Hygiene**: Proper layer ordering for better caching
7. **Explicit Dependency Versions**: Pinned uuid to version 9.0.1 for compatibility

## Testing and Verification

The solution was tested with multiple rebuilds and restarts, confirming:
- Containers start reliably without errors
- Services can communicate with each other
- Application runs correctly
- Containers can be stopped and restarted without issues

## Future Improvements

- Consider implementing multi-stage builds for production
- Add more robust service dependency checks
- Implement Docker volumes for persistent data
- Optimize container image sizes further
