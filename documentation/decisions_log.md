### [2024-04-08]: Modern CSS Grid Layout for Dashboard

#### Change/Decision Description
Replaced traditional MUI Grid components with modern CSS Grid layout via Box component to resolve TypeScript compatibility issues with MUI v7.

#### Rationale
- MUI v7 Grid component API changed, causing TypeScript errors with item/container pattern
- CSS Grid layout provides more flexibility and better browser support
- Box component with grid display property works consistently across MUI versions
- Simplifies the component tree and improves maintainability

#### Implementation Details
1. **Grid Implementation Issues**
   - TypeScript errors occurred with traditional Grid item/container pattern in MUI v7
   - Attempted several approaches to resolve typing issues

2. **Modern Solution**
   - Replaced Grid components with Box using CSS Grid layout
   - Implemented responsive columns with media queries
   - Maintained same visual layout while fixing type errors

#### Code Changes
```tsx
// Before: MUI Grid approach with TypeScript errors
<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
    <Paper>Content</Paper>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
    <Paper>Content</Paper>
  </Grid>
</Grid>

// After: Modern CSS Grid approach
<Box sx={{ 
  display: 'grid', 
  gridTemplateColumns: { xs: '1fr', md: '1fr 1fr' }, 
  gap: 3 
}}>
  <Paper>Content</Paper>
  <Paper>Content</Paper>
</Box>
```

#### Implications
- More direct use of modern CSS features
- Simplified component structure
- Better TypeScript compatibility
- Need to use this pattern consistently across the application

### [2024-04-08]: PowerShell Scripts for React Process Management

#### Change/Decision Description
Added PowerShell scripts (`kill-react.ps1` and `start-clean.ps1`) to manage React development processes, allowing for clean termination and startup of React development servers.

#### Rationale
- React development servers can sometimes hang or continue running in the background
- Port conflicts can occur when multiple instances are running
- Manual termination of processes is error-prone and time-consuming
- Automated scripts provide a consistent way to clean up and restart the development environment

#### Implementation Details
1. **kill-react.ps1**
   - Detects and terminates processes on ports 3000, 3001, and 3002 (typical React ports)
   - Identifies and terminates Node.js processes running React development servers
   - Terminates processes with specific command line patterns related to React

2. **start-clean.ps1**
   - Performs all cleanup operations from kill-react.ps1
   - Additionally starts a fresh React application instance with npm start
   - Provides a clean development environment for each session

#### Script Usage
```powershell
# Just kill React processes
.\kill-react.ps1

# Kill React processes and start a fresh instance
.\start-clean.ps1
```

#### Implications
- More reliable development environment
- Reduced port conflicts and process hanging issues
- Easier cleanup between development sessions
- Better development workflow with consistent process management
