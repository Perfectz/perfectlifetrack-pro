## Recent Decisions

### [2024-04-08]: Initial Project Setup

#### Change/Decision Description
Initial setup of the Perfect LifeTracker Pro project with React, TypeScript, and Azure services.

#### Rationale
- React and TypeScript provide strong type safety and component-based architecture
- Azure services offer scalable, reliable cloud infrastructure
- Material UI ensures consistent, accessible design system

#### Alternatives Considered
- Vue.js + TypeScript
- Angular
- AWS services
- Custom UI framework

#### Implications
- Need to maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Azure expertise required for deployment
- Material UI theming system must be followed

#### References
- React Documentation
- TypeScript Handbook
- Azure Architecture Center
- Material UI Guidelines

### [2024-04-08]: Branch Protection Ruleset Implementation

#### Change/Decision Description
Implementation of GitHub Branch Protection Ruleset for the master branch to ensure code quality and maintain project integrity.

#### Rationale
- Enforce code review process
- Prevent direct pushes to master
- Ensure all changes go through proper testing
- Maintain code quality standards
- Protect against accidental changes

#### Ruleset Configuration
1. **Pull Request Requirements**
   - All changes must go through a pull request
   - At least one approval required before merging
   - Branches must be up to date before merging

2. **Status Checks**
   - All required status checks must pass
   - Branches must be up to date with master
   - No bypassing of protection rules allowed

3. **Administrator Settings**
   - Rules apply to administrators
   - No force pushes allowed
   - No branch deletion allowed

#### Implications
- Development workflow must follow pull request model
- All changes must be reviewed before merging
- CI/CD pipeline must be properly configured
- Increased development time but improved code quality

### [2024-04-08]: Azure DevOps CI Pipeline Setup

#### Change/Decision Description
Implementation of Azure DevOps CI pipeline for automated building and testing of the Perfect LifeTracker Pro application.

#### Rationale
- Automated build and test process
- Early detection of integration issues
- Consistent build environment
- Automated artifact generation
- Integration with GitHub repository

#### Pipeline Configuration
1. **Build Stage**
   - Frontend build job
     - Node.js 18.x installation
     - npm dependency installation
     - React application build
     - Artifact publishing
   - Backend build job
     - Node.js 18.x installation
     - npm dependency installation
     - Backend application build
     - Artifact publishing

2. **Test Stage**
   - Frontend test job
     - Node.js 18.x installation
     - npm dependency installation
     - React application tests
   - Backend test job
     - Node.js 18.x installation
     - npm dependency installation
     - Backend application tests

#### Implications
- All code changes must pass build and test stages
- Consistent build environment across all developers
- Automated artifact generation for deployment
- Integration with GitHub pull requests
- Increased confidence in code quality

### [2024-04-08]: Azure DevOps Pipeline Optimization

#### Change/Decision Description
Optimization of Azure DevOps pipeline to work within free tier parallelism limits by running jobs sequentially.

#### Rationale
- Work within Azure DevOps free tier limitations
- Maintain build and test functionality
- Reduce pipeline complexity
- Optimize resource usage

#### Pipeline Changes
1. **Consolidated Stages**
   - Combined Build and Test stages into a single stage
   - Removed parallel job execution
   - Sequential execution of frontend and backend tasks

2. **Optimized Job Structure**
   - Single job for all operations
   - Sequential steps for:
     - Frontend build and test
     - Backend build and test
     - Artifact publishing

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Single Node.js installation
   - Reuse of build environment
   - Reduced pipeline complexity

#### Implications
- Longer pipeline execution time
- Simpler pipeline maintenance
- No parallelism limitations
- More efficient resource usage
