# Decisions Log

This document logs significant architectural and implementation decisions made during the development of PerfectLTP.

## 2025-04-15: Implement Lazy Container Initialization in Model Classes

### Change/Decision Description
Refactored all model classes (UserModel, TaskModel, FitnessModel) to implement a lazy container initialization pattern. This pattern:
1. Attempts to get the container during construction but doesn't fail if unavailable
2. Implements an `ensureContainer()` method that's called at the beginning of each data operation
3. Initializes the container on-demand when needed
4. Provides proper error handling for initialization failures

### Rationale
- The previous implementation caused circular dependency issues during application startup
- Model class constructors were being executed during module loading, before database initialization completed
- This led to constant container initialization failures and application crashes
- The lazy initialization pattern breaks this dependency cycle and provides a more robust startup sequence

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Singleton Database Client with Ready State**: Implementing a singleton database client with a ready state that models could check before operations. This was more complex to implement across all models.
2. **Service Locator Pattern**: Using a service locator to resolve dependencies at runtime. This would add complexity without solving the core timing issue.
3. **Factory Method Pattern**: Using factory methods to create model instances after database initialization. This would require significant refactoring of the codebase.

### Implications
- All model operations now have a small overhead of checking container availability
- Slight increase in code complexity with the additional `ensureContainer()` method
- More robust application startup that handles initialization timing issues gracefully
- Improved error handling and logging for database connectivity issues

## 2025-04-15: Update Database Initialization Sequence

### Change/Decision Description
Modified the database initialization sequence to:
1. Call `initializeCosmosDB()` first to ensure database and containers exist
2. Only then proceed with `seedDatabase()` to populate initial data
3. Added more robust error handling and logging throughout the process

### Rationale
- The previous sequence was not guaranteeing that containers were ready before seeding data
- Certain operations were failing silently during the initialization process
- Error logging was insufficient for debugging startup issues
- The updated sequence provides a clearer and more reliable startup flow

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Event-based Initialization**: Using an event system to signal when database is ready. This would add complexity for minimal benefit.
2. **Retry Logic**: Adding complex retry logic for operations. This was partially implemented but the core issue was the initialization sequence.
3. **Separate Initialization Process**: Running initialization as a separate process before the main application. This would complicate the deployment.

### Implications
- More predictable application startup
- Clearer logging of initialization steps and potential issues
- Slight increase in startup time due to sequential operations
- Improved development experience with better error reporting

## 2025-04-15: Standardize Docker Development Environment

### Change/Decision Description
Updated Docker configuration to:
1. Use consistent Node.js base images across containers
2. Implement proper volume mounts with `:cached` modifier for better performance
3. Add `.dockerignore` files to exclude unnecessary files
4. Create a simplified docker-compose configuration for development

### Rationale
- Previous Docker setup had inconsistent configurations leading to dependency issues
- Volume mounting without `:cached` was causing performance problems
- Missing `.dockerignore` files were causing unnecessary file transfers and build issues
- Complex Docker configuration was making local development difficult

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Development Without Docker**: Using local development environment without containers. This would lead to inconsistency between environments.
2. **Single Container Setup**: Combining frontend and backend in one container. This would not reflect the production architecture.
3. **Docker Dev Environments**: Using Docker Dev Environments feature. This was deemed too new and potentially unstable.

### Implications
- More consistent behavior between development and production environments
- Faster container builds with proper file exclusions
- Improved performance with optimized volume mounts
- Simplified development workflow with less configuration overhead
