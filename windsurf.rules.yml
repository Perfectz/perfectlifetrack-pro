# Windsurf Rules for Perfect LifeTracker Pro
# This file enforces and documents the required development and deployment workflows for this project.

rules:
  - id: enforce-docker-npm-scripts
    description: |
      All app lifecycle operations (start, stop, restart) MUST be performed using the provided npm scripts, which invoke Docker and manage all related processes.
    enforcement:
      - Only use these npm scripts for running/stopping the app:
          - npm start
          - npm run start:dev
          - npm run start:clean
          - npm run start:clean:dev
          - npm run stop
      - Do NOT run Docker commands directly or bypass the scripts.

  - id: container-cleanup-before-start
    description: |
      Before starting the application, always ensure all previous Docker containers and related processes are stopped and cleaned up.
    enforcement:
      - Always run: npm run stop before any start command.
      - Ensure no orphaned processes are using ports 3000-3003.

  - id: port-allocation
    description: |
      The application must only use ports 3000-3003 for frontend/backend services. These are managed by Docker Compose.
    enforcement:
      - Do not manually start services on these ports outside Docker.

  - id: env-configuration
    description: |
      All environment variables should be configured via Docker Compose or .env files managed by the npm scripts.
    enforcement:
      - Do not override environment variables manually at runtime.

  - id: volume-mounts-for-dev
    description: |
      For development, Docker Compose mounts local source directories as volumes for hot reloading.
    enforcement:
      - Do not edit files inside running containers; always edit on the host.

workflow:
  development:
    steps:
      - Run: npm run stop
      - Run: npm run start:clean:dev
  production:
    steps:
      - Run: npm run stop
      - Run: npm run start:clean

notes:
  - Always use the provided scripts for process and container management.
  - Never bypass Docker Compose or npm scripts for app lifecycle operations.
  - See docker-rules.mdc for legacy documentation.
