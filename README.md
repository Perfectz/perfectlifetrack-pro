# Perfect LifeTracker Pro

A comprehensive AI-powered personal assistant application designed to help users track fitness goals, personal development activities, and daily tasks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material UI (Vite)
- **Backend**: Azure Functions (Node.js)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform configuration for Azure resources

## Getting Started

### Running the Frontend

The frontend uses Vite for faster development and builds:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Or using Docker:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

### Running the Backend

The backend uses Azure Functions:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Infrastructure as Code

The project uses Terraform to define and manage Azure infrastructure:

```bash
# Navigate to the terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the deployment
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply tfplan
```

## Development Workflow

1. Make your changes
2. Test locally
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the repository
5. The CI/CD pipeline will handle deployment
